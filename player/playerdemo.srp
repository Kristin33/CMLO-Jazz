// some simple music generation: Here are some problems with this:
// - not very interesting
// - no manual control of anything
// - does everything: bass, chord, melody, instead of one thing
// - all piano sounds
// - cannot handle cur_beats_per_measure properly (assumes 4)
// - plays absurdly fast at faster tempos

    #    cur_stop_beat - what beat to stop on if you have started (you can
    #       stop slightly late; generally you should not start any notes 
    #       at or after tm_stop_beat but you can play a short note on

    #       vtsched may be updated instantaneously after this call.
